#### How to run it

The code is mainly based on the previous work ADL (https://github.com/junsukchoe/ADL).
Clone the repo and run:

```
sh EIL_scripts/train_EIL.sh
```

### Pretrained model

We provide the pretrained VGG16-EIL model at [Pretrained VGG-EIL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inDkUYKk5wOrWh4Lcfoy0ztxHNdbOY84/view?usp=sharing).
